# PROBLEM DEFINITION DOCUMENT (PDD)
Minetek / Breakthrough Management – Clean Gold & E-Waste Precious Metal Recovery

## 1. Problem Title

Fragmented, Under-Digitized, and High-Risk Precious Metal Recovery Operations Prevent Minetek & Breakthrough Management From Scaling Investor Confidence, Regulatory Trust, and Project Financing Across Mining Reclamation Sites and Urban Mining Operations.

## 2. Executive Summary

Minetek / Breakthrough Management operates across multiple high-value domains—mine reclamation, precious metal recovery, toll milling, and PCB/e-waste urban mining. While the core extraction technologies and proprietary processes are highly competitive, the organization currently faces systemic gaps:

*   No unified digital presence
*   Lack of investor trust layers, documentation, and compliance frameworks
*   Inconsistent communication workflows between sites, partners, and executives
*   A complex portfolio of projects with no centralized visibility for investors
*   Regulatory and legal ambiguities around environmental permitting, securities compliance, and technology disclosure
*   Underdeveloped digital marketing infrastructure required to attract capital, partners, and feedstock suppliers
*   Lack of standardized customer/investor journeys

These gaps prevent the company from scaling its operations and presenting a credible, professional, and compliant image to sophisticated investors, regulators, and partners.

## 3. Background

According to the Business Case Analysis :

*   Global e-waste has exceeded 62 million tonnes, rising faster than recycling efforts.
*   PCB boards contain 40–800x more gold per ton than mined ore.
*   Minetek/IMG’s proprietary electro-winnowing + benign reagent process achieves 86% gold recovery, outperforming competitors.
*   The JV structure is 60% IMG (technology) / 40% Eng & Associates (capital).
*   Sites planned across Burnaby BC, GTA, Montréal, Seattle, Las Vegas.
*   Five-site rollout by 2030 with projected USD 70M–120M revenue (depending on updated gold spot prices).

Despite the strong technical and market fundamentals, Minetek lacks the digital, operational, and investor-readiness frameworks needed to mobilize capital and credibility at scale.

## 4. Scope of the Problem

The problem spans four interconnected domains:

### 4.1. Operational Complexity Across 3 Distinct Project Categories

**A. Mine Reclamation Projects (High ESG + Environmental Impact)**

Priority sites include:
*   Gladstone Toll Mill – Idaho Springs
*   CRS LLC – Russell Gulch Reclamation
*   CRS LLC – Crown Mining Project – Central City
*   B Group Property
*   Gladstone Mines
*   Badger Mine Group

Problems:
*   No standardized evidence packets (environmental reports, assays, environmental liabilities, remediation plans).
*   No unified disclosure package for investors.
*   Lack of before/after dashboards or digital models.
*   Limited digital documentation to prove Minetek’s expertise or track record.

**B. Toll Processing (e.g., 1027 Toll Plant Company)**

Problems:
*   No pricing, intake, QA/QC workflows documented.
*   No communication journey for customers.
*   No automated reporting after each batch.
*   No marketing to drive inbound toll clients.

**C. Urban Mining – PCB/E-Waste Precious Metal Recovery (Non-PCB board method included)**

This includes IMG's proprietary electro-winnowing system + new non-PCB board reclamation workflows.

Problems:
*   Technology explanation is too technical/non-investor friendly.
*   No process map connecting mines → toll processing → urban mining → PCB method → non-PCB method.
*   Low trust due to lack of visual diagrams, SOPs, QA/QC proof.

### 4.2. Digital Presence & Authority Gaps

Minetek currently lacks:
*   A unified website
*   A professional knowledge base
*   Case studies
*   Proof of Work assets
*   Video narratives
*   Third-party trust signals
*   SEO and Google Ads infrastructure
*   LinkedIn + YouTube authority channels
*   Investor landing pages with gated material

This creates invisibility and credibility gaps that block capital flow.

### 4.3. Investor Journey & Compliance Problems

Current issues:
*   No standardized NDA → Data Room → Technical Report → Investor Presentation → Due Diligence → Subscription workflow.
*   No clarity around what “secret sauce” can be disclosed.
*   No clearly defined roles for:
    *   Andy Ferguson – CEO
    *   Gilbert Jones – EVP
    *   Eng & Associates – Capital Advisory
*   No system to qualify investors (506(c), NI 45-106, accredited status).

This creates operational risk and legal exposure.

### 4.4. Communication Workflows Are Fragmented

*   No CRM
*   No unified inbox
*   No automated follow-up
*   No HubSpot/GHL lead routing
*   No investor helpdesk
*   No site-to-executive reporting pipeline

This causes delays, missed opportunities, and inconsistent messaging.

## 5. Detailed Problem Definition

Minetek must transform from a technically strong but digitally invisible operation into a credible, compliant, investor-ready organization.

The core problems are:

### 5.1. Trust Deficit Among Investors & Partners

Because the extraction process involves environmental, chemical, and metallurgical claims, investors require:
*   Verifiable data
*   Independent assays
*   Engineering reports
*   Site photos and walkthroughs
*   Financial models
*   ESG impact documentation

Today, these materials are scattered, incomplete, or not formatted professionally.

### 5.2. Lack of a Unified Digital & Brand Framework

Minetek lacks:
*   Brand identity
*   Authority positioning
*   Narrative consistency
*   Professional communication templates
*   A “Clean Gold” brand story
*   Market-ready pitch decks

This reduces credibility.

### 5.3. No Standard Operating Architecture Across Projects

Every site works differently. There is no standard playbook for:
*   Feedstock receiving
*   Sampling
*   Environmental control
*   Stakeholder communications
*   R&D updates
*   Investor reporting

### 5.4. Marketing & Lead Generation Gaps

*   No landing pages
*   No keyword strategy
*   No SEO content
*   No remarketing ads
*   No YouTube investor education engine
*   No cold email infrastructure
*   No digital PR or authority building

This blocks investor inflow.

## 6. Combined Technology Map (Latest Update)

### 6.1. Mines → Toll → Urban Mining Technology Flow

**1. Mine Reclamation Workflow**
*   Environmental survey
*   Excavation + removal of ore/waste
*   Crushing
*   Gravity/floatation
*   Precious metal concentration
*   Shipment to Minetek/IMG for final recovery

**2. Toll Processing Workflow (1027 Toll Plant Co.)**
*   Client delivers ore
*   QA/QC assay
*   Batch processing
*   Concentrate output

**3. Urban Mining – PCB Precious Metal Recovery**

**A. PCB Method (IMG proprietary)**
*   Whole PCB intake
*   Crushing + shredding
*   Density separation
*   Electro-winnowing using benign reagent
*   86% gold recovery
*   Mixed metal concentrate (Au/Ag/Pt/Pd)

**B. Non-PCB Method (Latest addition)**
Used for:
*   Low-grade scrap
*   Device frames
*   Contact pins
*   Small electronics without PCB boards

Workflow:
*   Direct surface liberation
*   Mild reagent dissolution
*   Micro-precipitation + electro-recovery

## 7. Legal & Regulatory Challenges

You requested inclusion of all legal complications:
*   Environmental permitting + community engagement
*   Securities compliance for fundraising
*   IP protection of reagent & process
*   Cross-border material transport regulations
*   OSHA/WorkSafeBC compliance
*   Export limits on concentrates
*   Chain-of-custody requirements

Until solved, Minetek cannot safely raise the capital required.

## 10. Summary of the Core Problem

Minetek has:
*   A world-class technology
*   Multiple high-potential reclamation projects
*   A multi-site expansion plan
*   An ESG-aligned opportunity
*   Strong technical experts

But lacks the digital, compliance, communication, and trust infrastructure needed to secure capital, attract investors, and build long-term credibility.

Until these systems are built, the venture remains stalled at the awareness/trust phase.

## 11. What Success Looks Like (Definition of Done)

A successful solution means:
*   A complete digital presence
*   A gated investor portal
*   A compliant investor funnel
*   Proof-of-work documentation
*   Technology maps for all processes
*   A professional pitch deck
*   A top-down communication system
