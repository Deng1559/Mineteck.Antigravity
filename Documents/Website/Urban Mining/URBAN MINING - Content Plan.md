## **3. THE CHALLENGE: THE AI RESOURCE CRISIS**

**Headline:**  
Electronic Waste is the World’s Richest Gold Deposit.

**Body Copy:**  
The AI boom is creating a dual crisis: unprecedented demand for critical metals and a soaring volume of decommissioned data center hardware. Traditional mining is slow, toxic, and capital-intensive. Meanwhile, global e-waste exceeds 62 million tonnes per year, rising 5x faster than recycling capacity.

Urban Mining solves this by treating e-waste as a high-grade resource, not a liability.

## **4. THE SOLUTION: ZERO-WASTE RECOVERY**

**Headline:**  
40x to 800x Higher Concentration than Mined Ore.

**Body Copy:**  
We operate commercial-scale PCB recovery facilities that extract gold, silver, palladium, and platinum using a reagent-free, zero-cyanide extraction process.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD):** Our closed-loop water system eliminates tailings ponds and toxic effluent.
- **Traceable Supply Chains:** We provide full provenance for ESG-compliant metals.
- **Rapid Scalability:** Our modular facilities can be deployed near major data center hubs to minimize logistics costs.

## **5. HOW WE’RE DIFFERENT**

**Headline:**  
Operational. Not Experimental.

**Differentiators:**

- **Active Capacity:** 300 lbs of PCBs processed per hour at our Kent facility.
- **Proprietary Reagents:** We avoid the cyanide and mercury traditional mining requires.
- **Secured Offtake:** Direct relationships with global metals brokers ensure immediate monetization of concentrates.
