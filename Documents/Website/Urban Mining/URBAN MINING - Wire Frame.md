# **URBAN MINING**

### **Recovering Tomorrow’s Resources from Today’s Electronic Waste**

**Urban Mining** is a clean-technology operating company within the **Breakthrough Management** ecosystem, focused on recovering precious metals from electronic waste using environmentally responsible, commercially proven processes.

We transform discarded electronics—specifically printed circuit boards (PCBs)—into high-value metal concentrates while eliminating the toxic inputs and environmental risks associated with traditional mining and legacy recycling.

**This site is informational. It is not an offer to sell securities.**

---

### **Why Urban Mining**

Global demand for gold and critical metals is accelerating—driven by data centers, AI infrastructure, and electronics manufacturing—while traditional mining faces rising costs, environmental constraints, and permitting delays.

At the same time, electronic waste has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally.

Urban Mining addresses this imbalance by treating e-waste as a resource, not a liability.

---

### **What We Do**

Urban Mining operates commercial-scale PCB recovery facilities that extract precious metals from electronic waste using non-toxic, zero-cyanide processing methods.

Our operations are designed to:

- Recover metals efficiently from high-grade urban feedstock

- Reduce environmental and regulatory friction

- Support traceable, ESG-aligned metal supply chains

---

### **How We’re Different**

Urban Mining is **operational**, not experimental.

**Key differentiators include:**

- Commercial processing capacity (hundreds of tons annually)

- Partnership with proprietary clean-recovery technology providers

- Secured concentrate offtake through established global metals channels

- Processing methods that avoid cyanide, mercury, and high-emission smelting

This positions Urban Mining as a **complement** to traditional mining—not a replacement—within a diversified metals strategy.

---

### **Where We Fit**

Urban Mining is part of a broader clean-mining and resource-recovery strategy overseen by **Breakthrough Management**, alongside advanced mining technologies and infrastructure initiatives.

The Urban Mining platform provides:

- Shorter operational cycles

- Faster validation of clean-processing economics

- A real-world demonstration of ESG-aligned resource recovery

---

### **Who This Is For**
