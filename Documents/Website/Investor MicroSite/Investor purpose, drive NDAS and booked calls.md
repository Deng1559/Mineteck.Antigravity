# **SECTION 2 — THE INVESTMENT CONTEXT (WHY THIS EXISTS)**

### **Title**

**Gold Recovery Faces a Structural Inefficiency**

### **Three Short Blocks (Investor Framing)**

**1\. Legacy Recovery Models**

* Significant gold locked in:

  * Electronic waste

  * Legacy mine tailings

  * Dump ore

**3\. Rising Demand for Traceable Metals**

* Technology infrastructure growth

* AI, electrification, advanced manufacturing

* Increased scrutiny on sourcing and accountability

**Close**  
 This disconnect creates an opportunity for recovery platforms that can deploy capital efficiently while managing technical and regulatory risk.
