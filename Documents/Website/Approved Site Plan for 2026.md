## **1\. Executive Summary (What Was Decided)**

This meeting confirmed alignment on a **portfolio-first investment architecture** supported by a **multi-site digital ecosystem** that moves investors from awareness → validation → accreditation → NDA → capital deployment.

**Core agreement:**

* **Breakthrough Management** \= philosophy, capital allocation discipline, opportunity screening, governance.  
* **MineTeck** \= technology execution, operational proof, MRU deployment, reclamation capability.  
* **Urban Mining** \= flagship proof-of-execution inside the portfolio (not a standalone retail investment).  
* **Investor access must remain accredited-only**, with gated disclosure via NDA \+ data room.  
* The website ecosystem is not marketing fluff—it is **investment infrastructure**.

This is not a brand rebuild.  
 It is an **investor qualification and trust acceleration system**.
