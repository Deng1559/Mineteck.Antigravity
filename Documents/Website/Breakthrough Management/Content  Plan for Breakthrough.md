**A New Era of Mining Investment – Proven, Clean, and Profitable**

Breakthrough Management Gold Fund I offers investors direct access to the transformation of the global mining industry. The fund is positioned to capitalize on record metal demand by investing in disruptive, clean-mining technologies and projects that unlock metal value from historic tailings, low-grade ores, and e-waste, while eliminating the toxic liabilities of traditional mining.**I. Investment Thesis & Strategy**

* **The Problem:** The global mining industry faces critical challenges: inefficient recovery, massive toxic waste generation, and restrictive permitting. Billions of dollars in precious and critical metals remain locked in above-ground waste.  
* **The Solution (Our Mandate):** The Fund invests in technologies and projects focused on:  
  * Higher recovery rates (recovering metals from historic tailings and legacy ore).  
  * Zero-waste / Zero-toxicity processing (e.g., Mineteck’s proprietary systems).  
  * Accelerated, compliant permitting (achieving "zero effect for 1,000 years" in EPA-approved testing).  
* **The Edge:** The Manager provides a competitive advantage through 14 years of industry experience, existing off-take contracts with global refiners, proven ability to permit operations in restrictive states like Colorado, and hands-on operational support (finance, HR, project management) to de-risk early-stage companies.
