Below is the **updated Breakthrough Management wireframe (v2.0)**, rewritten to align with the **new approved ecosystem architecture** and to clearly separate:

* **Breakthrough \= Capital, Governance, Project Structuring**

* **MineTeck \= Technology Authority**

* **Green Gold \= Narrative / Urban Mining Micro-Site**

* **Investor Portal \= Compliance \+ Conversion Engine**

This **replaces the prior Breakthrough wireframe** and is ready for **InstantDesign, Andrew, and Gilbert** to act on.
