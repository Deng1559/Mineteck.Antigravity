## **2. BUSINESS CONTEXT**

### **Organization Background**

MineTeck is the technology platform delivering modular, mobile solutions for precious metals recovery. The primary product is the **Mobile Research Unit (MRU)**, a 7-trailer modular system that allows for complete, on-site recovery from both Urban Ore (e-waste) and Legacy Ore (mine waste).

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD):** No tailings ponds or toxic effluent.
- **Environmentally Benign Reagents:** No cyanide or toxic acids.
- **Mobile Deployment:** 7-trailer modular system that processes material where it sits.
- **Rapid Permitting:** Minimal environmental footprint leads to faster approvals.
