# **MINETECK - CONTENT PLAN**

## **1. HERO SECTION**

**Background Image:** [MineTeck Mockup](file:///C:/Users/denni/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0374f495-af04-426d-acd4-720af99f8338/mineteck_homepage_mockup_1768331998989.png)

**Headline:**  
MINING EVOLVED.  
MODULAR. MOBILE. ZERO-WASTE.

**Subheadline:**  
MineTeck provides the world’s first vertically integrated, zero-waste mobile metals recovery platform. We process precious metals where they reside—eliminating logistics, toxins, and environmental liabilities.

## **2. THE PROBLEM: A LEGACY OF WASTE**

**Headline:**  
Billions in Stranded Value. Millions in Environmental Liability.

**Body Copy:**  
Traditional mining has left behind a legacy of abandoned waste piles (tailings) and toxic ponds. With over 28,000 abandoned mines in the U.S. alone, billions of dollars in gold and critical minerals remain trapped because traditional extraction is too slow to permit and too expensive to transport.

## **3. THE TECHNOLOGY: THE MOBILE RESEARCH UNIT (MRU)**

**Headline:**  
A Fully Permittable Extraction Plant in 7 Trailers.

**Body Copy:**  
Our Mobile Research Unit (MRU) is a modular, site-specific extraction system designed to validate feedstock and recover high-purity metals on-site.

**Trailer Breakdown (Visual UI Component):**

- **Trailer 1 (Intake):** Automated feedstock sorting and analysis.
- **Trailer 2 (Crushing):** Low-dust, high-efficiency material reduction.
- **Trailer 3-5 (Extraction):** Proprietary, non-cyanide reagent circuits.
- **Trailer 6 (ZLD Cycle):** Closed-loop water recirculation and toxin capture.
- **Trailer 7 (Output):** High-purity metal concentrates and dore bars.

## **4. THE ZERO-WASTE ADVANTAGE**

**Headline:**  
Zero Liquid Discharge. 1,000-Year Proof.

**Core Pillars:**

- **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD):** We eliminate the need for tailings ponds. Our system recirculates water and captures all residues for safe, circular-economy repurposing.
- **Non-Toxic Chemistry:** No cyanide. No record of environmental toxicity. 3rd-party testing shows non-toxic effect for 1,000 years.
- **Rapid Deployment:** While traditional mines take 7–12 years to permit, an MRU can be deployed in weeks under existing reclamation frameworks.

## **5. PARTNERSHIPS: MONETIZE YOUR WASTE PILE**

**Headline:**  
Turn Your Liability Into a Revenue Stream.

**For Mine & Land Owners:**  
We provide complete, on-site recovery with zero CapEx from the landowner. We handle the permitting, the operation, and the remediation, leaving your land cleaner and your balance sheet stronger.
