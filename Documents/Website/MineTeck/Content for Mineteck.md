**MineTeck: Sustainable Mining & Reclamation Services**

**Executive Summary & Mission**  
MineTeck is a For-Profit social, environmental, and reclamation services company specializing in designing, developing, and deploying zero-waste mining processing systems that capture precious metals and restore land. Its mission is to design, develop, deploy, recover, and restore land invaded by abandoned tailing piles from mining activities, supporting environmental conservation and preserving the integrity of the water table.

**The Problem**  
The current mining industry produces enormous waste (tailings), which is often toxic and affects the environment, people, and the economy, making mining permits difficult to obtain. Annually, the world demands 20 billion tons of minerals, generating significant residual by-products.

**The Solution & Core Competencies**  
MineTeck focuses on a **"zero waste, zero toxicity"** approach to redefine the mining process and create a circular economy.

* **Reclamation:** Removing and processing dump ore piles in Colorado and beyond.  
* **Zero-Waste Process:** New methods, processes, and technologies that eliminate the creation of toxic tailings and create value-based usage for residual material.  
* **Permitting:** MineTeck's founder achieved the first permitted toll mill operation on a major waterway in Colorado since 2002 by proving out the "zero waste, zero toxicity" process through rigorous 3rd party testing (TCLP, WET, SPLP, ABA test) that showed a non-toxic effect for 1,000 years.  
* **Downstream Products:** Repurposing clean waste as eco-fertilizers and sustainable building products.

**Key Technology: Mobile Research Unit (MRU)**  
The MRU is a rapid, deployable, modular processing circuit on seven trailers designed for material recovery and remediation.

* **Key Features:**  
  * **Self-Contained:** Utilizes water recirculation, reducing overall water intake.  
  * **Zero Liquid Discharge:** A permittable design that prevents groundwater contamination and eliminates the need for tailings ponds.  
  * **Toxin Capture:** Proprietary filtration membranes absorb hazardous material for safe handling and disposal.  
* **Current Status & Goal:** The MRU currently operates at a capacity of 15 tons per hour (TPH). R\&D is focused on scaling this to **50 TPH** by adding a crushing unit and upgrading equipment.

**Key Projects & Experience**  
MineTeck is actively developing and pursuing multiple projects, primarily focused on gold mining and reclamation in Colorado's "Richest Square Mile."

* **Gladstone Mill, Colorado:** The first fully permitted toll mill in Colorado in 20 years. Serves as a keystone project for the company, with a current capacity of 3 TPH and plans for expansion.  
* **Russell Gulch, Colorado:** A joint venture project involving historic gold dump ore, with an estimated 100K+ tons of material.  
* **Project "B", Colorado:** Historic gold mining site with an estimated 500K+ tons of dump ore, adjacent to the Gladstone Mill property.  
* **Rip Van Dam Mine, CO:** A platinum, palladium, and rhodium mine near Boulder, pending resolution of access issues.

**Funding Request**  
MineTeck is actively seeking an investment of **$2.8 million** to enhance the production capabilities of its Mobile Research Unit.

* **Use of Funds (Phase 1 Expenses \- $2,800,000 Total):**  
  * Scale Processing Capacities (upgrade from 15 TPH to 50 TPH).  
  * Major expenses include: Ball Mill ($800,000), Crusher ($500,000), Engineering and Field Testing ($400,000), and Laboratory Extension ($400,000).

**Future Goals**

* **Year 1 (2026):** Establish 2 operations with revenue generation between $5M and $10M per site.  
* **Year 3:** Expect to have 6 locations with $5M \- $10M revenue.  
* **Year 5:** Expect 10 locations. Distribution channels for fertilizer and eco-friendly byproducts come online.  
* **Year 10:** Goal is to generate **$200 million** in the North American Markets per year.
